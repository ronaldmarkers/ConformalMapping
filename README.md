The following animation was constructed with the spirit of the visualization of complex functions illustrated in 3Blue1Brown's Riemann Hypothesis video. This animation highlights the conformal mapping of a specific linear transformation known as figure 14 in Ruel Churchill's Complex Analysis viewed below.
